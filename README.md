# BuildWithSpecs

BuildWithSpecs is a free methodology and toolset for building better software with AI assistance through **Spec-Driven Development**.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development is a structured approach to software development that puts planning first. Instead of jumping straight into coding with AI tools and dealing with unclear requirements and constant rewrites, you create a detailed specification before any code is written.

Think of it like building a house - you wouldn't start construction without blueprints. Similarly, you shouldn't start coding without a clear plan.

## The Problem We Solve

When working with AI coding assistants, many developers face:

- **Unclear requirements** that lead to building the wrong thing
- **Scope creep** where projects grow beyond their original intent
- **Constant rewrites** because the AI didn't understand what you wanted
- **Team misalignment** where everyone has a different vision

## How It Works

Spec-Driven Development follows a simple 4-step process:

1. **Requirements** - Define your goals and project scope clearly
2. **Design** - Plan your architecture and how components will work together
3. **Tasks** - Break down the work into manageable pieces
4. **Build** - Let AI implement your well-defined specification

By spending time on steps 1-3, step 4 becomes dramatically faster and more accurate.

## What You Get

- **10x faster planning** - Structured templates guide you through the planning process
- **85% fewer rewrites** - Clear specs mean AI builds it right the first time
- **100% team aligned** - Everyone works from the same specification document

## Getting Started

## Who Is This For?

- Developers using AI coding assistants who want better results
- Teams that need to align on project direction before coding
- Anyone tired of unclear requirements leading to wasted development time
- People who want to work smarter with AI, not harder

## Philosophy

This is a free and open methodology. We believe better planning leads to better software, and everyone should have access to these practices. Spec-Driven Development works with any AI coding tool and any programming language.
